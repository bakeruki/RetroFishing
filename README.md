# RetroFishing
In Retro Fishing, you play as a very innocent and cute farmer bunny and your goal is to catch fish! When your bobber touches a fish, the fish will become hooked and you must reel it in to collect it for money.

This game is a very early WIP.

# Controls
Hold down space to charge up your cast and let go to release! (there is no power meter right now because I'm lazy)

Once you have hooked a fish, hold down space again to reel in!
